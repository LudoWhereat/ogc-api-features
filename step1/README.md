After the install NodeJS and clonen of the Master branch, lets start node with a basic script.
The basic script starts a webserver, listening on port 80 and replies with `Hello World!`

## 1: open command prompt
With a command prompt, go to the directory where you put the repo

```
node index.js
```

http://localhost

The browser now shows: 
> `Hello World!`
